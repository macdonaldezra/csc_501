## MySQL

This project uses MySQL which can be installed by following the instructions found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) for your respective operating system.

## Install Project

This project uses Python 3.9. If you do not have Python 3.9 explicitly installed on your machine, I recommend using a tool like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install it as it allows you to install and easily manage multiple Python versions and virtual environments. Once you have Python 3.9 installed, you can run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
